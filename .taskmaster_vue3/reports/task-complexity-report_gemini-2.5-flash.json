			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Docker Compose Environment",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Setup Docker Compose Environment' into a sequence of subtasks. Start with the database service, then the backend, and finally the frontend. For each service, detail the necessary Docker Compose configuration including image/build context, ports, volumes, environment variables, and network settings. Also, include subtasks for creating the corresponding Dockerfiles for the backend and frontend services.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to orchestrating three distinct technologies (Python, Node.js, MongoDB), configuring inter-service networking, and managing data persistence with volumes. Each service has its own build and runtime configuration, increasing the number of potential failure points."

			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Future: Implement Login/Logout (Frontend)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Login/Logout (Frontend)'. Create subtasks for: 1. Building the Login view with a form. 2. Setting up a Pinia store for authentication state (token, user info). 3. Implementing the login function to call the API and save the JWT. 4. Configuring an Axios interceptor to attach the token to all subsequent requests. 5. Implementing the logout functionality to clear the token and state. 6. Adding route guards to protect authenticated routes.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the need for robust state management (Pinia), secure handling of credentials (JWT), modification of the global API client (Axios interceptor), and creation of new UI components and routing logic. It's a core feature with many interconnected parts."

			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "API: Implement DELETE /posts/{id} Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Implement DELETE /posts/{id} Endpoint'. The subtasks should cover: 1. Creating the FastAPI path operation decorator for `DELETE /posts/{post_id}`. 2. Implementing the function to call the database to delete the document by its ID. 3. Adding logic to check if the delete operation was successful and return a 404 error if the document was not found, otherwise return a 204 status code.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity as it's a standard, well-defined CRUD operation. The logic is self-contained: receive an ID, execute a single database command, handle one primary error case (not found), and return a standard HTTP response."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "API: Implement POST /posts Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement POST /posts Endpoint'. Create subtasks for: 1. Defining the FastAPI endpoint that accepts a POST request and uses the Pydantic post model for body validation. 2. Implementing the logic to insert the new post data into the MongoDB collection. 3. Ensuring the endpoint returns the newly created post object, including its database-generated ID, with a `201 Created` HTTP status code.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity. It's a standard 'Create' operation. The use of Pydantic for validation simplifies the code, but it still involves request body handling, database insertion, and formatting the response, making it slightly more involved than a simple GET."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "API: Implement PUT /posts/{id} Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Implement PUT /posts/{id} Endpoint'. The subtasks should include: 1. Creating the FastAPI endpoint for `PUT /posts/{post_id}` that accepts the ID and an update payload. 2. Implementing the database logic to find the specified post. 3. Adding error handling to return a 404 if the post ID does not exist. 4. Applying the update payload and returning the complete, updated post object upon success.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity. It's a standard 'Update' operation. It requires handling both a path parameter and a request body, finding the specific document, applying changes, and handling the not-found error case."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Post List Page",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Frontend: Post List Page'. Create subtasks for: 1. Creating the `PostListView.vue` file and registering it in the Vue Router. 2. Scaffolding the component's template to display a list of posts, initially using a hardcoded array of mock post objects. 3. Styling the page layout, the post list, and a 'Create New Post' button using TailwindCSS. 4. Ensuring each post title is a link (`<router-link>`) to a dynamic post detail route.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity. It's a foundational UI task involving the creation of a new view, basic data binding (`v-for`), and styling. The complexity is kept low by deferring the API integration to a separate task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "API: Implement GET /posts Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Implement GET /posts Endpoint'. The subtasks should be: 1. Create the FastAPI path operation for `GET /posts`. 2. Implement the database query to fetch all documents from the `posts` collection and return them as a list.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity. This is a straightforward 'Read-all' operation. It requires a single database query with no parameters and minimal data transformation before returning the response. An empty list is a valid success response."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "API: Implement GET /posts/{id} Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement GET /posts/{id} Endpoint'. Create subtasks for: 1. Defining the FastAPI endpoint that accepts a post ID as a path parameter. 2. Implementing the database logic to find a single post by its ID. 3. Adding error handling to raise a 404 HTTPException if no post with the given ID is found.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity. A standard 'Read-one' operation. The main logic is a single database lookup, with the addition of a common error handling path (404 Not Found), which makes it slightly more complex than a simple GET-all."
		},

			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Post Detail Page",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Frontend: Post Detail Page'. The subtasks should be: 1. Create the `PostDetailView.vue` file and set up a dynamic route (e.g., `/posts/:id`) in the router. 2. Implement logic to read the post ID from the route params and display details from a corresponding mock data object. 3. Design the template to cleanly display the post's title, content, and metadata. 4. Add placeholder 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons to the view.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity. It involves creating a view, handling route parameters, and displaying structured data. The complexity is contained by using mock data and not yet implementing the button actions or API calls."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Define Post Data Model",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Define Post Data Model'. Create subtasks for: 1. Creating the file `/app/models/post.py`. 2. Defining a Pydantic `BaseModel` named `Post` that includes all specified fields: `title`, `content`, `category`, `author_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` with their correct Python types and default values where appropriate.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity. This is a declarative task of defining a data structure based on clear specifications. It's a single file, single class implementation with no complex logic, making it a quick and straightforward task."
