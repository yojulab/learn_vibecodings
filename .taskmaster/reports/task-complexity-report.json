			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Frontend Project (React + Vite + TailwindCSS)",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Setup Frontend Project (React + Vite + TailwindCSS)' into a series of sequential subtasks. The subtasks should cover initializing the project with Vite, integrating TailwindCSS, setting up ESLint for linting, setting up Prettier for formatting, and finally, ensuring ESLint and Prettier work together without conflicts.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves multiple, distinct configuration steps that are well-documented but need to be done in sequence. A complexity of 3 reflects that it's more than a single command but doesn't involve complex logic. 5 subtasks are appropriate to track each major tool's integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Backend Project (FastAPI)",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Setup Backend Project (FastAPI)' into logical subtasks. The plan should include initializing the Python environment and dependencies, establishing a scalable directory structure (for routes, models, services), creating the main application entrypoint with a health check, defining an initial Pydantic model, and setting up the first API router.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard backend initialization task. The complexity is low (2/10) because it follows a well-established pattern for FastAPI projects. The 5 subtasks provide a clear, step-by-step guide to creating a scalable project foundation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Configure MongoDB Integration and Data Model",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Configure MongoDB Integration and Data Model' into a sequence of subtasks. The subtasks should cover installing the necessary drivers (motor), setting up environment variables for the connection string, creating a reusable database connection module, defining the Pydantic models for the Post schema, and creating a test endpoint or script to validate the write/read operations.",
			"reasoning": "Complexity is moderate (5/10) due to the need to manage external service connections, handle asynchronous database operations with `motor`, and manage configuration securely. The 5 subtasks correctly isolate each critical step: dependency management, configuration, connection logic, data modeling, and validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Backend Post CRUD API Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Implement Backend Post CRUD API Endpoints' into subtasks based on the CRUD operations. The plan should include a setup subtask for defining the necessary Pydantic models and the API router, followed by separate subtasks for implementing the 'Create' (POST), 'Read' (GET all and by ID), 'Update' (PUT), and 'Delete' (DELETE) endpoints.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is 6/10 as it involves implementing the core business logic of the application. Each CRUD operation is a distinct piece of work with its own logic, data handling, and potential error states. Breaking this down into 5 subtasks (one for setup, and one for each of C, R, U, D) is the most logical approach."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Configure CORS and API Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Configure CORS and API Documentation'. The subtasks should guide the developer through adding the CORS middleware, configuring the allowed origins for the frontend, specifying allowed methods and headers, creating a simple test to verify the configuration, and finally, ensuring the auto-generated API documentation remains accessible.",
			"reasoning": "This is a low-complexity (2/10) configuration task, as FastAPI provides built-in support that is easy to implement. The 5 subtasks provide a comprehensive checklist to ensure CORS is configured correctly and tested thoroughly, which is good practice despite the low difficulty."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Frontend: Post List View Component",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Build Frontend: Post List View Component'. The plan should include creating the main view component file, implementing the logic for data fetching and state management (loading, error, data), creating a reusable child component for a single post item, rendering the list conditionally based on state, and adding navigation links to the detail view.",
			"reasoning": "This task has a moderate complexity of 5/10 because it combines UI rendering, asynchronous data fetching, state management, and component composition. The 5 subtasks effectively break down the work into manageable steps: component structure, data logic, child component creation, conditional rendering, and user interaction (navigation)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build Frontend: Individual Post Detail View",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Build Frontend: Individual Post Detail View'. The subtasks should cover configuring the dynamic route (e.g., /posts/:id), creating the component skeleton, implementing the logic to fetch a single post using the ID from the URL, rendering the fetched post's data (title, content), and applying basic styling.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is 4/10, slightly less than the list view, as it handles a single entity. However, it introduces the concept of dynamic routing. The 5 subtasks correctly address the key aspects: routing setup, component creation, data fetching based on a URL parameter, rendering the data, and styling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build Frontend: Post Creation and Editing Form",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Build Frontend: Post Creation and Editing Form'. The subtasks should focus on creating a reusable component. The plan should include: 1. Building the static form UI. 2. Implementing controlled component state for all fields. 3. Adding submission logic for creating a new post (POST). 4. Adapting the form to pre-populate data and handle updates (PUT). 5. Implementing client-side validation and user feedback.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex (7/10) because it involves creating a reusable component for two distinct modes (create/edit), managing complex form state, handling submissions with different API calls (POST/PUT), and implementing validation. The 5 subtasks logically separate the work into building the UI, managing state, implementing the create logic, adapting for edit mode, and adding validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Frontend Delete Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Frontend Delete Functionality'. The plan should include adding a delete button to the UI, creating a reusable confirmation dialog component, wiring the button to trigger the dialog, implementing the API call to the DELETE endpoint upon confirmation, and handling the UI update (e.g., redirection) on success.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is 4/10. While the API call is simple, the task requires managing UI state for a confirmation dialog, which adds a layer to the user interaction flow. The 5 subtasks provide a robust plan, including creating a reusable dialog component, which is a good architectural choice."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Category Filtering",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the full-stack task 'Implement Category Filtering'. The subtasks should cover both backend and frontend work. The plan should include: 1. Updating the backend `GET /posts` endpoint to filter by category. 2. Creating a new backend `GET /categories` endpoint. 3. Building the frontend filter UI component. 4. Implementing the client-side logic to call the correct API when a filter is selected. 5. Ensuring the post list view updates with the filtered data.",
			"reasoning": "This is a full-stack feature with a complexity of 6/10. It requires coordinated changes on both the backend (modifying one endpoint, adding another) and the frontend (new UI, state management, and updated data fetching logic). The 5 subtasks correctly divide the work into backend changes, frontend UI, and the client-side logic that connects them."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Responsive UI with TailwindCSS",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Responsive UI with TailwindCSS' into subtasks based on the major UI areas. The plan should include separate subtasks for making the main application shell (nav/footer) responsive, the post list view, the post detail view, the create/edit forms, and any other key components like the category filter.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is 5/10. It's not about writing complex logic but requires careful, detailed work across the entire frontend codebase to ensure a consistent and functional user experience on all screen sizes. Breaking it down by major UI component (shell, list, detail, form, filter) as the 5 subtasks do is an effective strategy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Add UI Feedback and Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Add UI Feedback and Error Handling'. The plan should be based on integrating a library like React Query. Subtasks should include: 1. Integrating the chosen library (e.g., React Query). 2. Setting up a global toast notification system. 3. Refactoring the Post List view to use `useQuery` with loading/error states. 4. Refactoring form submissions to use `useMutation` for feedback. 5. Refactoring the Post Detail view.",
			"reasoning": "This task has a complexity of 7/10 because it involves a significant architectural refactor to use a state management library like React Query. This is more than just adding a loading flag; it changes how data is fetched and cached globally. The 5 subtasks correctly structure this as: 1. Setup the core library. 2. Setup the feedback mechanism (toasts). 3-5. Systematically refactor each part of the app."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Form Validation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Form Validation' into a set of full-stack subtasks. The plan should include: 1. Defining server-side validation rules using a Pydantic model. 2. Integrating this model into the FastAPI endpoints. 3. Adding basic client-side validation to the form. 4. Implementing logic to display user-friendly error messages. 5. A final subtask for end-to-end testing of the validation.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is 4/10. Server-side validation is straightforward with FastAPI/Pydantic. The client-side part requires some state management for error messages but is a common pattern. The 5 subtasks provide a full-stack approach, covering the backend model, backend integration, and two layers of frontend validation, plus final testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Refactor Code and Add Basic Tests",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Refactor Code and Add Basic Tests'. The plan should address both frontend and backend. Subtasks should include: 1. Refactoring the frontend component structure. 2. Refactoring the backend to separate business logic from routes. 3. Writing unit tests for the new backend service layer. 4. Writing basic component tests for the frontend. 5. Performing a full manual regression test.",
			"reasoning": "This is a high-complexity task (8/10) involving significant code reorganization (refactoring) and the introduction of a new discipline (testing). It requires a holistic view of the project's architecture. The 5 subtasks are well-structured, separating frontend/backend refactoring and testing, and concluding with a crucial manual regression test."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Future Enhancement: Markdown Editor Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Future Enhancement: Markdown Editor Integration'. The subtasks should cover the entire implementation process: 1. Installing the chosen Markdown editor library. 2. Replacing the textarea in the post form with the editor component. 3. Ensuring the raw Markdown is submitted to the API. 4. Using a library to render the saved Markdown as HTML in the detail view. 5. Styling both the editor and the rendered content.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is 6/10. It involves integrating a third-party UI library, which can be complex, and requires changes in two key places: the form (for input) and the detail view (for rendering). The 5 subtasks perfectly map the lifecycle of this feature: installation, integration, data handling, rendering, and styling."
